# SCHOOL_DMBS
Designed and implemented a School Examination Management System as part of the Database Systems Lab, progressing from logical design to a fully functional multi-page application.

The system supports end-to-end CRUD operations with strong referential integrity and role-based access control. The backend schema was refined using foreign keys with cascading deletes to ensure data consistency and prevent orphan records. A modular architecture was adopted to separate student and staff workflows, improving maintainability and scalability.

Key emphasis was placed on real-world database design, complex SQL joins, conditional insert/update logic, and enforcing business rules at the database level.
